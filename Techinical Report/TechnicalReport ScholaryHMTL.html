      <h2>Introduction</h2>
      <p>
        Music was always a way to entertain or to escape reality in a good way. 
		Music is a part of our lives and with every occasion we are accompanied by songs. 
		The humans behave in such a way they colors the life they live. Movies are covered 
		in music, theaters, lessons, public transport and publicity and many others are 
		related to music in order to have a great impact. 
	</p>
	<p>
		Music smart assistant story begins with the 
		need of customization of all music we listen or we want, even related with other apps 
		from the phone or web. In order to be up-to-date with our favorite music, a smart assistant 
		can make better recommendations, faster than us. So MusSmart stays for the music and smart, 
		these two words makes everything perfect. This app is multi-platforms and gives the offline mode. 
		Offline mode is required for the places with no internet and signal, and the application 
		stores in xml libraries songs and the user can use it.  

      </p>
	  <p>
        The number of daily users we expected to grow every time because now we release the free version.
		The growth is shown even in the number of hardware platforms our clients run on, the number of 
		development teams that work with our products, the number of external apps we host on our platform, 
		the number of songs we have in our catalogue.
      </p>
	  <p>
		We will make a lot of efforts in order to render at a minimum time the content wanted especially 
		for the search and discover area, because those two are in changing and is vital for the user.
		As we say before, we offer the offline support. The offline area is available from the application 
		to the device, mobile or desktop. Offline mode is required for the places with no internet or secure 
		Wi-Fi or for no signal, like airplanes. So, the songs added to favorites, the history, and all the 
		playlists saved/ album saved are available to listen offline by storing them into device, and synchronizing,
		and transfer from the app with a <a href="https://www.w3.org/XML/">XML</a> shareable playlist (<a href="http://xspf.org/specs/">XSPF</a>).
	  </p>
	  <p>
		The search for offline will works for the stored songs, but some areas will be available when a connection 
		to internet is made. The important past is that the user doesn’t have to download the songs in the device, 
		because they are contained in application.
	  </p>
	  <p>
		Another aspect of this music smart assistant is Facebook integration. We want the user to be connected 
		with the artists he likes and follows on Facebook. Also for upcoming events like festivals, concerts, 
		immediately a song appear related to that event, it will be displayed to user in discover section of 
		the application.
	  </p>
	  <p>
		Lyrics search and lyrics displayed on play is possible with MusSmart. We thought it would be really 
		convenient to allow tracks to be searched by lyric query. When we talk about search, we’re talking 
		about both the search query itself and the index of search terms. First, we build an index based on 
		the open source search engine Elasticsearch (indeed the entire MusSmart search engine relies on it).
		We index <a href="https://www.json.org/">JSON</a> documents representing track lyrics. Querying lyrics text however is more akin to a 
		traditional search on a text document where the frequency of the query must be taken into account. 
		In order to compute a score that reflects the matching between the user query and the track lyrics, 
		we use the ElasticSearch Function Score Query.

        <!-- review? -->
        <h3> Web app  design and interaction</h3>
        
		<p>
			MusSmart have so many option for a listener, so the user find here all he wants from a 
			music application. The pages are organized in 2 categories: MusSmart and My music.
		</p>
		<p>
			<i>In the first part the user found:</i>
		</p>
		
		
		<li>
			Welcome user and sign in/register

			“Welcome to MusSmart” and has two option: to log in or to register in case the user are 
			a new client for our site. For the registration (sign up) we offer the opportunity to 
			sign up with Facebook or by Google account.
			</p>
			<p>
			The registration requires: email, username, password, confirm password, country and terms 
			and condition clauses checkbox and link to those. For the instance we not required card 
			details to use the application, but for the future we consider that. 

			</p>
		</li>
		<li>
			Preferences context
			<p>
			After registration, a dialog show up and the user must choose the genre that he likes 
			(as blues, pop, indie, rock, trap, classical etc), and for the clicked ones, the genres a
			re selected, next he must pick up the artists related to the genres liked before. The number 
			is unlimited, so will be a checkbox with “Select all”.
			</p>
		</li>
		<li>
			Home page
			<p>
			The home page offers the overview of the latest songs and albums, artists, different tops 
			(Top Pop Songs, Top Romanian songs), the lasts concert record. These will be placed by 
			sections: Recommendation, then History, Latest albums released, artists, new playlists 
			by genre and events.
			Search button is visible anywhere after registration in order to facilitate the use of 
			application. So here the user, can type and search songs, artist or tags

			</p>
		</li>
		<li>
			Discover (Recommendations)
			<p>
			This page display different genres, related artists or the songs of a specific artists that 
			the user listen often. In this section it can be displayed the songs alike another songs 
			after a significant number of replays.  Also it displays subjects beyond music (podcast, 
			football, podcast). The application automatically track the interests and search new songs 
			to show to user. In average the part of every subject contains from 7 to 10 
			In Discover, the user can access an interactive map (mind map) of artists with their songs 
			and related artists they collaborate with.

			</p>
		</li>
		
		<p>	
		<i>In My music section are the following pages:</i>
		</p>
		<li>
			Favorites
			<p>
			This page display different genres, related artists or the songs of a specific artists that 
			the user listen often. In this section it can be displayed the songs alike another songs 
			after a significant number of replays.  Also it displays subjects beyond music (podcast,

			</p>
		</li>
		<li>
			Playlists
			<p>
			The user can create playlists for their preferences in this way: they play a song and from

			</p>
		</li>
		<li>

        <h3>Methods</h3>
		<a href=""></a>
        <p>
          In order to develop this application for the users, we need the technical structure. This 
		  application is based on <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Representational_state_transfer">REST</a> services and APIs and the data stored in <a href="https://www.w3.org/XML/">XML</a> format from a 
		  database. The website client is developed in PHP.
		  </p>
		  <p>
			The <a href="https://www.last.fm/api">Last.fm API</a> is REST-based and uses XML-formatted responses, but this detail is abstracted 
			from us by the PHP Last.fm API library. We can interface with Last.fm through the methods.
		</p>
			The Last.fm artist resource returns information about an artist, events the artist is performing, 
			and the artist’s most popular tracks. To start, let’s search for an artist using the library’s 
			Artist::search() method.
		</p>
		<p>Last.fm is a social website which has a music recommendation engine at its core. It keeps 
		track of its users’ music tastes, and offers events, wikis, and discographies for artists. 
		All of the data is gathered using a Audioscrobbler database plugin installed with each user’ 
		music player (Spotify, Winamp, iTunes, etc.). Above all, Last.fm has a rich and impressive 
		API which developers can use to build mobile and web mashups.It allows you to get information on 
		users, artists, albums, tracks, groups, events and tags. It also contains geographic API classes 
		to get musical geo information
        </p>
		<p><b><a href="https://www.last.fm/">Last.fm</a></b></p>
		<b>Link API:</b><a href="https://www.last.fm/api"> https://www.last.fm/api</a> 
		
        <p>
		As database used, Last.fm delivers a Restful API exposing a comprehensive database of albums, artists, 
		titles, playlists, events and users via <a href="https://www.json.org/">JSON</a> and <a href="https://www.w3.org/XML/">XML</a>. The digital radio station provides an impressive 
		toolset for the developing community.
		</p>
		<p>
		It lacks a sandbox mode, as well as live on-page API testing, but with a clear and comprehensive 
		developers page, we won't complain too much. 
		</p>
		
		<p><b>Fetching Last.fm Playlists </b></p>
		<p>
		Use the playlist.fetch method call to fetch <a href="http://xspf.org/specs/">XSPF</a> playlists. XSPF is a web standard for sharable 
		playlists, and XSPF libraries are available in several languages. playlist.fetch takes a 'lastfm' 
		protocol URL as an argument; this identifies the playlist you're requesting. The following protocol 
		url schemes are currently supported:
		</p>
		<li><strong>Album Playlists</strong>: lastfm://playlist/album/&lt;album_id&gt;</li>
                <li><strong>User Playlists</strong>: lastfm://playlist/&lt;playlist_id&gt;</li>
                <li><strong>Tag Playlists</strong>: lastfm://playlist/tag/&lt;tag_name&gt;/freetracks</li>
		
		<p>
		Playback
		</p>
		<p>
		If you'd like to add play links to your playlist you can link to the Last.fm track page (which 
		will be present in the XSPF extension node), appending '?autostart' to the URL.
		</p>
		<p>
		<b>
		<a href="http://xspf.org/specs/">XSPF</a></b>
		</p>
		<p>
		<b>Provider:</b> <a href="https://www.xiph.org/">Xiph.Org Foundation</a></p>
		<p>
		<b>API Documentation URL:</b> <a href="http://www.xspf.org/quickstart/">http://www.xspf.org/quickstart/</a>
		</p>
		
		<p>
		A listener community grown out of Audioscrobbler. Listeners send information about each track 
		they play to Last.fm. That way Last.fm can build statistics about your music habits and make 
		suggestions for music you might want to check out in the future.
		</p>
		<p>
		 XSPF is the <a href="https://www.w3.org/XML/">XML</a> format for sharing playlists. 
		 <li>It is portable. You should be able to carry a playlist from one place to another.</li>
		<li>It is well-engineered. Most playlist formats have bugs that make life harder for programmers 
		and users.
		</li>
		<li>
		It is free (as in liberty) and open. No proprietary lock-in.
		</li>
		<p><b><a href="https://www.elastic.co/fr/products/elasticsearch">ElasticSearch</a></b></p>
		<p><b>Provider:</b><a href="https://www.elastic.co/fr/products/elasticsearch">Elastic</a></p>
		
		<p>
		Some API available for this application is ElasticSearch for the lyrics search and display. 
		Elasticsearch is a distributed RESTful search and analysis engine designed to meet a multitude 
		of use cases. And their list keeps getting rich. The cornerstone of the Elastic Suite, it centralizes 
		the storage of your data and allows you to widen the range of possibilities. Your data no longer have
		any secrets for you. 
		</p>
		<p>
		Whenever a user performs an action in the Mussmart client—such as listening to a song or searching 
		for an artist—a small piece of information, an event, is sent to our servers. Event delivery, the 
		process of making sure that all events gets transported safely from clients all over the world to 
		our central processing system, is an interesting problem. In this series of blog posts, we are going 
		to look at some of the work we have done in this area.
